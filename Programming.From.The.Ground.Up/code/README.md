# Programming-from-ground-up
tasks from the book "Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett

I have spent too much time for reading this book. So written code with comments
looks impure and sometimes strange. Do not mind about that. I hardly will make
any cosmetic changes, but who knows. At this moment I am tired of this book.
