# PURPOSE: Write a program that will add a single 
#          record to the file by reading the data from
#          the keyboard. Remember, you will have to make 
#          sure that the data has at least one null
#          character at the end, and you need to
#          have a way for the user to indicate
#          they are done typing. Because we have not
#          gotten into characters to numbers conversion,
#          you will not be able to read the age in from
#          the keyboard, so youâ€™ll have to have a default age
